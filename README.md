# Project: Building a Student Intervention System
## My 2nd Project in the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

### Project Overview
A local school district has a goal to reach a 95% graduation rate by the end of the decade by identifying students who need intervention before they drop out of school. As a software engineer contacted by the school district, my task was to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam, by constructing an intervention system that leverages supervised learning techniques.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Run

In order to run the code in the jupyter notebook you also need the file **student-data.csv**. You can find this file in the Udacity project repository linked in the beginning of this readme.

Load the file with jupyter notebook using the following command:

```jupyter notebook student_intervention.ipynb```
